# What is this repository for?

This is my repository for card and set data that I worked on for the Weiss Schwarz simulator by Blake Thoennes, linked here: https://blakethoennes.itch.io/weiss-schwarz

I made this so that I can keep track of what sets I have worked on, when I worked on them, and what I changed between updates. This will also serve as a public changelog for others to view and a public way for peers to review the code I worked on without needing to download the files.

# What is the Weiss Schwarz Simulator?

It is an application created by Blake Thoennes that simulates a game of Weiss Schwarz, a card game by Bushiroad that utilizes various anime and video game series. The simulator allows for an automated system for card effects and progressing through a player's turns. It can be played with an AI, and against other people locally or online. It can be downloaded for Windows, Linux, and Mac via the link above with no installation needed.

## How to add a custom/DLC set from my repository:
1. Click the green Code button
2. Click Download ZIP from the dropdown menu
3. Extract the folders into ...[game folder]/Weiss Schwarz_Data/StreamingAssets/Cards
- Extracting all of the folders will allow you to play with all of the sets available in the repository
- Selecting which folders you want to play can save storage
4. Run the game
5. Enjoy

Note: If you wish to play with someone else using a custom/DLC set, you will both need to have the set folder in your game folders respectively for the game to recognize and load the cards correctly.

## Sets I'm Working On
I will continue to work on sets I am interested in. I am open to taking requests but they will likely be a lower priority. JP sets will take longer because of the current lack of an info parser like for the EN sets (at least until a parser for JP sets comes out). There is always the chance that sets under "Finished" will still have bugs here and there, so please feel free to let me know of any issues and I will correct them as soon as I am able.

### Finished
* The Quintessential Quintuplets (Booster + TD)

### In Testing:
* The Quintessential Quintuplets ∬

### Currently working on:
* N/A

### Backlog because of missing effects
* Log Horizon (anti-burn effect)

### Sets I Plan to Work On Eventually (and will work on if no one will take them):
#### EN:
* Kancolle (including Abyssal Fleet)
* Love Live! (only the OG sets)

#### JP:
* The Quintessential Quintuplets Movie
* Clannad (stand-alone sets + relevant cards in crossover sets like Key All-Stars)
* Shin Sakura Taisen
* Love Live! Nijigasaki
