# Weiss Schwarz Simulator Card and Set Data

This is my repository for card and set data that I worked on for the Weiss Schwarz simulator by Blake Thoennes, linked here: https://blakethoennes.itch.io/weiss-schwarz

I made this so that I can keep track of what sets I have worked on, when I worked on them, and what I changed between updates. This will also serve as a public changelog for others to view and a public way for peers to review the code I worked on without needing to download the files. Please feel free to let me know of any bugs and issues and I will fix them ASAP.

## How to install a set:
1. Click the green Code button
2. Click Download ZIP from the dropdown menu
3. Extract the folders into Weiss Schwarz_Data/StreamingAssets/Cards
  - Extracting all of the folders will allow you to play with all of the sets available in the repository
  - Selecting which folders you want to play can save storage
4. Run the game
5. Enjoy

## Sets
I will continue to work on sets I am interested in. I am open to taking requests but they will likely be a lower priority. JP sets will take longer because of the current lack of an info parser like for the EN sets.
