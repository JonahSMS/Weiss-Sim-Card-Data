# Weiss Schwarz Simulator Card Data

This is my repository for card data that I worked on for the Weiss Schwarz simulator by Blake Thoennes, linked here: https://blakethoennes.itch.io/weiss-schwarz

I made this so that I can keep track of what sets I have worked on, when I worked on them, and what I changed between updates. This will also serve as a public changelog for others to view and a public way for peers to review the code I worked on without needing to download the files.

Currently working on:
* The Quintessential Quintuplets Vol. 1 (Booster + TD)

Backlog:
TBD
