# Weiss Schwarz Simulator Card and Set Data

This is my repository for card and set data that I worked on for the Weiss Schwarz simulator by Blake Thoennes, linked here: https://blakethoennes.itch.io/weiss-schwarz

I made this so that I can keep track of what sets I have worked on, when I worked on them, and what I changed between updates. This will also serve as a public changelog for others to view and a public way for peers to review the code I worked on without needing to download the files. Please feel free to let me know of any issues and I will fix them ASAP.

How to install a set:
1. Download the folder of the set you wish to play
2. Put the set folder into Weiss Schwarz_Data/StreamingAssets/Cards
3. Run the game
4. Enjoy

Currently working on:
* The Quintessential Quintuplets Vol. 1 (Booster + TD)

Backlog:
* TBD
